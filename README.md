</div>

This repository implements a control-theoretic framework for **safe navigation** using **analytically constructed density functions**. The proposed approach guarantees **almost-everywhere (a.e.) convergence** to the goal while ensuring **obstacle avoidance** without requiring artificial potential fields or trajectory optimization.

## Construction of Density Functions
This figure shows how to construct inverse bump functions to represent arbitrarily shaped obstacles. 
<div align="center">

</div>

We use the inverse bump functions with a distance function to form the overall density function. The density takes zero value at obstacles, max value at the goal, and smoothly varying elsewhere, allowing its gradient to naturally guide the agent to the target while avoiding collisions.

## Safety in Almost Everywhere (a.e.) sense
This figure illustrates that the controller avoids unsafe sets and converges to the target from almost all initial conditions, even in the presence of local non-convexities. The flow of the density gradient ensures that only a negligible set of initial states (defined by the zero measure set) may fail to reach the goal safely.

## Safe Navigation in Complex and High-Dimensional Environments
This simulation demonstrates how the density-based controller handles cluttered environments with irregular obstacle shapes, guiding the agent safely through narrow passages and around complex obstacles using only the gradient of the density.

## Comparison with Navigation Functions
This comparison highlights the advantage of density-based control over traditional navigation functions. While navigation functions may get stuck near saddle points or require careful tuning, the density framework provides smoother, safer trajectories and avoids undesirable local minima.

## Applications to Robotic Systems
This example shows the controller applied to a **2-link robotic arm** in its configuration space. Even with joint-level constraints and obstacle-avoidance requirements, the controller enables a smooth, collision-free trajectory with almost everywhere safety guarantees. (switch to ```robotic_arm``` branch for this simulation).

## Extensions to Dynamic Environments
In this example, the density-based controller is able to account for time-varying obstacles (gray) and track a time-varying target (green). Even though the target passes through the unsafe sets, the density-based controller always finds a safe trajectory
