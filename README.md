<div align="center">

</div>

This repository implements a control-theoretic framework for **safe navigation** using **analytically constructed density functions**. The proposed approach guarantees **almost-everywhere (a.e.) convergence** to the goal while ensuring **obstacle avoidance** without requiring artificial potential fields or trajectory optimization.

This repository accompanies the publication: Safe Navigation Using Density Functions (RA-L)

## Construction of Density Functions
This figure shows how to construct inverse bump functions to represent arbitrarily shaped obstacles. 
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/psi_2d_2.png" width="700" alt="Bump Function Construction" />
</div>

We use the inverse bump functions with a distance function to form the overall density function. The density takes zero value at obstacles, max value at the goal, and smoothly varying elsewhere, allowing its gradient to naturally guide the agent to the target while avoiding collisions.

</div>

## Safety in Almost Everywhere (a.e.) sense
This figure illustrates that the controller avoids unsafe sets and converges to the target from almost all initial conditions, even in the presence of local non-convexities. The flow of the density gradient ensures that only a negligible set of initial states (defined by the zero measure set) may fail to reach the goal safely.

## Safe Navigation in Complex and High-Dimensional Environments
This simulation demonstrates how the density-based controller handles cluttered environments with irregular obstacle shapes, guiding the agent safely through narrow passages and around complex obstacles using only the gradient of the density.

## Comparison with Navigation Functions
This comparison highlights the advantage of density-based control over traditional navigation functions. While navigation functions may get stuck near saddle points or require careful tuning, the density framework provides smoother, safer trajectories and avoids undesirable local minima.

## Comparison with Control Density Functions
In this comparison, we show a comparison of control barrier functions with various tuning parameters. Note that specifying the degree of safety for the density functions through the sensing region $s$ is more intuitive and easier to tune compared to the $\gamma$ parameter in CBFs.

## Applications to Robotic Systems
**Robotic Arm**: This example shows the controller applied to a **2-link robotic arm** in its configuration space. Even with joint-level constraints and obstacle-avoidance requirements, the controller enables a smooth, collision-free trajectory with almost everywhere safety guarantees. (switch to ```robotic_arm``` branch for this simulation).

</div>

**Quadruped Robot**: In this example, we use the safe trajectory obtained from the density-based controller as a motion plan for quadruped locomotion. The robot uses a hierarchical framework (https://github.com/AndrewZheng-1011/legged_planner) to achieve safe navigation.

## Extensions

**Dynamic Environments**: In this example, the density-based controller is able to account for time-varying obstacles (gray) and track a time-varying target (green). Even though the target passes through the unsafe sets, the density-based controller always finds a safe trajectory 

Scenario 1:

</div>
Scenario 2:

</div>

**Control Density Functions (CDFs)**: In this extension, we use density functions to formulate a quadratic program for safe control synthesis. The following example shows safe control trajectories obtained for a double-gyre flow field.

</div>

**Handling Uncertainty**: Density functions can easily account for uncertainty in the system states. The following example shows safe trajectories obtained for a dynamic bicycle model in the presence of uncertainties.
